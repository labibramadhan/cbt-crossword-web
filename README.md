This is the open source version of my original project called Ujian Berbasis Komputer - Teka-teki Silang (Computer Based Test - Crossword). So this closed source project does exist since 13 September 2016. The open source version initialized on 12 January 2017.

The differences from the closed source version are:

1. Variable names translated from Indonesian to English
